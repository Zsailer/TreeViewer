### Interactive Biology Visualizations 

Scientific data is alive and dynamic, so why should your graphical interpretations of such systems remain static? To accurately represent and explain their behavior, you need a set of tools that will keep up with your data! 

Meet IBViz. 

IBViz is a project striving to create interactive visualization tools for the biological sciences. It employs D3.js to manipulate data and bring your plots/figures to life. This is a work-in-progress and is not ready for public use. Dependencie include D3.js, Bootstrap, and JQuery.
